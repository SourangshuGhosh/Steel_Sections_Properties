# Steel_Sections_Properties
A Python software able to calculate the cross-section properties of combined steel sections. If the cross section is a polygon, there are formulas for calculating the section properties from the coordinates of the vertices. Most of the formulas are on the aforelinked Wikipedia pages and on this very nice page from Paul Bourke of the University of Western Australia
