# Steel_Sections_Properties
A Python software able to calculate the cross-section properties of combined steel sections. If the cross section is a polygon, there are formulas for calculating the section properties from the coordinates of the vertices. The properties of greatest importance are the area, the location of the centroid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid), and the moments of inertia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area). Most of the formulas are on the aforelinked Wikipedia pages and on this very nice page http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonmesh/  from Paul Bourke of the University of Western Australia.
